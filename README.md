# Farhan's Friends-Photo-Gallery- (FFF)
Interactive photo gallery with CSS Transitions, javascript and Transforms.

WHY:
- I came up with this as a tribute to all the friends I have made in Ottawa after I arrived here in 2014 as an international student.Each and every moment I spent with them is precious and truly memorable.

- Each image of my friends has a quote represting who they are to me, some of the quotes have been taken from the following websites.

- Photos were downlaoded from FB with permission from my friends and I will be sharing this site with them.

- Since 12 photos were required I creted this page 3 colums and 4 rows of images.
_ I didnt want it to be clustered and that why I went with this design choice, wanted to keep it neat and simple:

WHAT: 
- By designing this gallery the things I learnt more about are 
the use of container for images and  different types of overlay Methods for photo descriptions.
- Learnt more about contating data in pages using DOM.
- Learnt different types of animations for photo layout and design.

HOW: 
- Created a single page HTML.
- Used Javascript to add images to the webpage instead of CSS.
- used multiple div's to create animations within pages.
- set basic elemet styling in css.
- set media quries for responsive on different device platforms.
- set page elements and photo overlays on css.
- used transform elements.
- used onload element so that as soon as the page is loaded javascript is enabled.
- Each photo in every row contains a different interacive animation to show the profiles detail and description of my friends.
